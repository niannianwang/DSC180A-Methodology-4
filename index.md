What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
I have been hearing a lot about agentic ai. I was able to utilize this opportunity to gain hands-on expereinces in building applications using agentic ai for gathering privacy settings across web applications.

Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
Our quarter 2 project will be a continuation of our quarter 1 project. I would hope that users can give commands about how they want to adjust their privacy preferences, and our model is able to make changes accordingly. More ambitiously, if the model can learn about different users' general privacy preferences across platforms, the model can help the user adjust to similar settings across different platforms.

What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
Our team is considering about the scalability about our product. For example, is the number of API calls sustainble, is the model and script generalizable to different platforms? Instead of just making sure our product work, we also want to think about cost-effectiveness and runtime.

What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
I would hope we build a sustainble database to store all the data we have collected. A good extend of our product would be that it will also  to continue to store newer settings over time, and we also hope to allow people in the future can also look at what privacy settings or features are offered in the past.
